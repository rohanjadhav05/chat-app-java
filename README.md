# WebSocket
1. A WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. It enables bidirectional communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server, allowing them to send messages to each other at any time without the need to constantly poll for new information.
2. WebSocket is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional HTTP communication, which is typically request-response-based and doesn't allow servers to initiate communication with clients. With WebSocket, once the initial connection is established, both the client and the server can send messages to each other independently.
